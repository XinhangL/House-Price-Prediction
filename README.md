# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This notebook demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict house prices based on various input features. The project is a great example of applying basic machine learning concepts to real estate data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict the sale price of houses based on characteristics such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location
- **Techniques**: Linear regression using both `statsmodels` and `sklearn`
- **Evaluation**: Model summary, coefficient analysis, confusion matrix (if classification), and interpretation

---

## 🧠 Key Techniques

- Data preprocessing with `pandas`
- Linear regression model with `statsmodels.OLS`
- Train/test split using `train_test_split`
- Evaluation with `.summary()` and visualization
- Optional: `LogisticRegression` (likely exploratory or misnamed)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place `house.csv` in the same directory as the notebook
2. Launch Jupyter or VS Code and open `house linear.ipynb`
3. Run all cells to reproduce the regression analysis and results

## 📈 Highlights

- Use of both OLS (from `statsmodels`) and sklearn-based modeling
- Strong focus on regression interpretation and feature importance
- Prepares you to handle more complex regression-based prediction tasks
